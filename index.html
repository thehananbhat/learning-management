        The world has become hyper-competitive. In order to stay ahead, professionals are looking for alternative ways of advancing their careers − and online degrees are a popular choice. Online education has many advantages over traditional classes, and a degree obtained online can work wonders for your career. Recent trends in the world of education have replaced traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms with web based learning opportunities. The internet has shrunk the world, and there are many compelling reasons why virtual learning is proving to be the preferred choice of many students today.
        <br><br>Anytime, anyplace learning: 
For sheer convenience, online learning trumps traditional learning all the way. Being able to access the learning material anytime and anyplace helps learners to better balance their work and study commitments. Online learning favors independent learning styles, and self-directed learners can achieve their academic goals at their own pace while keeping up with their other responsibilities.
<br><br> <strong>Flexibility: </strong>
Flexible class schedules are another advantage. If you work during the day, you can choose to sign up for a class that runs at night, when you are free. Most virtual training programs also allow you to attend a class in another batch if you have missed one session. E-learning modules can be easily squeezed into bursts of time that you may find during the day. Carry your laptop with you and you can complete class work and assignments as you go.
Cut out the commute!
E-learning modules can be studied at your own pace, while virtual classrooms require you to log in at a stipulated time. Both ways, you can study from wherever you are, which means that you can eliminate a long and crowded commute. Get more free time to do whatever you want!
<br><br><strong>Easy on your pocket:</strong> 
Tuition fees for online courses are typically available at a fraction of the cost of the fees at a regular institution. Additionally, e-courseware and online resources reduce the cost of textbooks, and discounts may be available for deserving students.
Global training:
Traditional learning is limited by the proximity of institutions in your location. Online learning crosses geographies and you can attend a class delivered by a teacher who is halfway across the world. You can connect with experts in real time and get your questions answered in online forums. You can work in groups, just as you would in a regular classroom, and can interact in online meeting spaces.
<br><br><strong>Rich learning experiences:</strong>
Unlike in a regular classroom, online learning modules can stimulate and engage the minds of learners with a mix of interactive visual and auditory media. Virtual field trips, video clips, and links to simulations stretch the learning experience and aid in retention. Online exercises, test papers and worksheets can be attempted many times over till the material is perfected; and this is especially useful in case of training programs that prepare students to sit for certification exams.
<br><br><strong>Recordings:</strong> 
A huge advantage of online classes is that class recordings are made available for students to revisit so that they can refresh the concepts learnt during the session. If a class is missed, you can always play the recording and make up the session work. The ability to replay video streams is a great advantage over classroom learning.
With innovations in the world of education, new models of learning are constantly emerging and evolving. One thing that’s for sure is that virtual classrooms are here to stay!
